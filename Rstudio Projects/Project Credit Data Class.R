# In this Linear Regression Exercise, build models to predict Balance using other variables
# read the data
df = Credit

# Structure of the dataset


# Take the X variable out
df$X = NULL

# Check the structure of the dataset


# Summary of the dataset


# convert Gender, Student, Married, and Ethnicity to factor


# check str


# correlation matrix, check correlation of Balance with other variables
# Take note of correlation of Balance with other variables
# Take note of the relationship between Rating and Limit

#scatterplot matrix, check relationship of Balance with other variables


# Boxplot Balance vs Gender, is Gender variable important?


# Boxplot Balance vs student, is Student variable important?


# Boxplot Balance vs Married, is Married variable important?


# Boxplot Balance vs Ethnicity, is Ethnicity variable important?
